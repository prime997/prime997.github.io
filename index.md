# Welcome
This is a collection of my Notes on everything.

## Why Keep Notes?
Mostly, because I forget everything. Analogies, stories, and mnemonics help me to remember facts, ideas, and concepts. Writing and rewriting forces me to reflect on information. Looking at problems in different ways helps me to understand.

## Prolific Note-Takers
Prolific note-takers[^1] include: Leonardo di Vinci,[^2] Thomas Edison,[^3] and Samuel Hartlib.[^4]

[^2]: Leonardo da Vinci (1452 to 1519) needs no introduction. He was *the* prolific note-taker, with thousands of pages still in existence.

[^3]: Thomas Edison (1847 to 1931) is probably the most experienced note-taker in the world. His diary, which is still maintained in historical records, contains five million pages!

[^4]: Samuel Hartlib (1600 to 1662) set out with the universalist goal "to record all human knowledge and to make it universally available for the education of all mankind." Hartlib's correspondence and notes, over 25,000 pages, were published in 1995 on CD. They are available free of charge on the web. [The Hartlib Papers](https://www.dhi.ac.uk/hartlib/)

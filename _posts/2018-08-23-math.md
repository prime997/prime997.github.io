Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible
berry of several species of $E=mc^2$ woody vines in the genus Actinidia.

   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
\end{equation}

The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large
hen's egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) in
diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or
golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.
